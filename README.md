  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-preemptive)
  - Round Robin

- **Memory Allocation Strategies**
  - First Fit
  - Best Fit
  - Worst Fit

- **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**
  - FCFS
  - SSTF
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN
  - LOOK
  - C-LOOK

- Rich Visualizations:
  - Gantt Charts
  - Disk Movement Graphs
  - Memory Block Visualization
  - Dynamic process and block tables

-  Interactive UI with:
  - Real-time inputs
  - Auto-generated test cases
  - Metric cards (WT, TAT, RT, Fragmentation, Utilization)
